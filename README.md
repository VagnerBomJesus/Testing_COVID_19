# Android APP ( Testing COVID-19 )

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Information such as **Name**, **Country**, **District**, **Email**, **Telephone** and the **Level** of all users diagnosed with COVID-19, theirs information will be available to doctors, as a way of being able to contact them according to user's situation.

The user can also make **questions related to COVID-19** that can be answered by the doctor soon as possible. All questions considered relevant will be available in the **FAQ** visible to any user of the application.

### How this app works?
I developed an application on Android devices that can evaluate if the user of the application has symptoms similar to COVID-19, answering the questions of multiple choice personalized by doctors. The level may vary **Mild**, **Severe**, **Very Severe**.
